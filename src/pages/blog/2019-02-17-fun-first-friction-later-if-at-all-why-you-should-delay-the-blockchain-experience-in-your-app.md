## Show me value first

We are at the beginning of the Web 3.0 revolution. As it is the early days of this revolution there is a lot of friction around onboarding. This friction has likely been one of the main factors holding dapps back from achieving a scale typical of web 2.0 apps.

We are currently working on a mobile gaming dapp called Meme Wars. In testing an initial prototype with an audience of “non-crypto-enthusiasts,” it became clear that requiring users have a wallet already set up and have some crypto to start engaging with the dapp provides way too much friction. We believe this is in line with expectations set by Web 2.0 apps, where users are accustomed to fun first, friction later. Whether that friction be time or money, users expect the value of your app will be established before they invest any of their valuable time or money. Currently setting up Metamask and learning your way around is a non-trivial investment of time and brainpower for people that are new to the space and have come to use your dapp not learn about blockchain.

Based on some of our user testing, we’d like to argue that a better way is to provide a frictionless Web 2.0 version of your product that establishes value and fun for new users unfamiliar with blockchain. Delay the blockchain onboarding as long as possible and only when necessary introduce it. At this point if your dapp has been well-designed and truly serves a need you will have established that value to users and they will be more likely to go through the friction of onboarding and unfamiliar blockchain based concepts like “wallet”, “seed”, “there’s no password reset option”, “you’ll lose your money if you lose this password.”
